        We - the development team of Codesearch - are a group of students from
        Austria.<br/> We originally got the idea for Codesearch in 2009 when we
        were working together with the company Infonova GmbH during a school
        project.<br/> Infonova was using a self developed program called
        SVN-Search, which they used company-internal and was pretty much a
        basic version of todays Codesearch. <br/> It had only very few features
        and our original task was to extend it. During our school project -
        which was on for about a year - we added some functionality to
        SVN-Search, but we were never really satisfied with the result.<br/>
        The basic design of SVN-Search allowed almost no extensions in any way,
        so when it was time for us to decide on a topic for our diploma thesis
        in 2010, we asked the people at Infonova if they would be interested in
        a new version of SVN-Search with a lot of additional features. However,
        after a few discussions we realized, that Codesearch could be much more
        than we can make it into, we would need the help of a community. That's
        why we decided to make it Open Source, also our main attention during
        programming was, to make it as extendable as possible.<br/> <br/> The
        original team itself consits of three developers:<br/> David Fr√∂hlich
        ,<br/> Samuel Kogler and <br/>Stephan Stiboller
