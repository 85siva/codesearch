// Please feel free to add items to this list!

Missing features
================
 - Extended file information: e.g Author, Commit date etc
 - Highlight search term
 - Jump between found results
 - Repository file browsing
 - Raw file button
 - Autocomplete
 - Enum Handling for Code Navigation
 - Preserve Index Consistency feature
 - Display file without code navigation button

Important TODOs
===============
 - Refactor every System.out that is not in a Unit test
   This helps debugging problems; please use appropriate logging levels
 - Fix exception handling; quite often, 
   problems are just caught and ignored 
   See that exception handling is consistent throughout the program
 - Refactor database to be consistent(clearing should remove all dependent data
   sets)
 - When the error message display is finished, refactor searcher error handling
   to actually use it!
 - Refactor Exception Handling in IndexingTask
 - rewrite plugin loader so multiple plugins for a single purpose can be loaded

Bugs
===============
 - XmlCodeAnalyzer takes reaaallly long to analyze some files
 - Either find a way to preserve \n chars at parsing or completely replace the JavaParser with the EclipseAstParser
 - In external code navigation front end has no way to get filepath and repo
   after a jump

Minor Bugs
===============
 - usages of parameters in methods are not correctly linked
 - add external code navigation for attribute types

Unexpected Behaviour
===============
 - When using an overloaded method with an external field or external method as parameter it can not be correctly determined which method is the correct one

Missing documentation
===============
 - Make sure all classes are documented (not the methods, but the classes)
