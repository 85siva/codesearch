// Please feel free to add items to this list!

Missing features
================

 - Autocomplete
 - Highlight search term
 - Jump between found results
 - Repository file browsing
 - Raw file button
 - Extended file information: e.g Author, Commit date etc
 - Enum Handling for Code Navigation
 - Preserve Index Consistency feature

Important TODOs
===============
 - Refactor every System.out that is not in a Unit test
   This helps debugging problems; please use appropriate logging levels
 - Fix exception handling; quite often, 
   problems are just caught and ignored 
   See that exception handling is consistent throughout the program
 - Find out why some files won't show up in the index
 - Change imports from blob to an extra table
Minor Bugs
===============
 - usages of parameters in methods are not correctly linked
 - if no record for repository exists in database it should automatically be created
 - PropertyManager constantly assumes that the property file does not exist, therefor creates a new one
 - execution of code analysis sometimes causes an exception at databse access -> try with empty database
 - when looking at a file and hitting the back button, the search result retrieved in the search before is not displayed, so you have to enter the search information again
 - make the release of the connection in each DBAccess method finally

Unsolveable bugs
===============
 - When using an overloaded method with an external field or external method as parameter it can not be correctly determined which method is the correct one

Missing documentation
===============
