Important TODOs
===============
 - Refactor every System.out that is not in a Unit test
   This helps debugging problems; please use appropriate logging levels

   problems are just caught and ignored 
   See that exception handling is consistent throughout the program

When using an overloaded method with an external field or external method as parameter it can not be correctly determined which method is the correct one
