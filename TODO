// Please feel free to add items to this list!

Missing features
================
 - Extended file information: e.g Author, Commit date etc
 - Highlight search term
 - Jump between found results
 - Repository file browsing
 - Raw file button
 - Autocomplete
 - Enum Handling for Code Navigation
 - Preserve Index Consistency feature

Important TODOs
===============
 - Refactor every System.out that is not in a Unit test
   This helps debugging problems; please use appropriate logging levels
 - Fix exception handling; quite often, 
   problems are just caught and ignored 
   See that exception handling is consistent throughout the program
 - Change imports from blob to an extra table
 - Make parameter check when looking for the line number of a method declaration in an external method call
 - Refactor database to be consistent(clearing should remove all dependent data
   sets)
 - When files are deleted, also delete them from the database!!
 - In DBAccess, return a different exception/error code if an entry could not
   be found -> currently its always a DatabaseAccessException, no way to find
   out what went wrong
 - When the error message display is finished, refactor searcher error handling
   to actually use it!

Bugs
===============
 - Ignore lists(Blacklists) do not work at all
 - Some files won't show up in the index
 - External code navigation usage lookup doesn't work

Minor Bugs
===============
 - usages of parameters in methods are not correctly linked
 - if no record for repository exists in database it should automatically be created
 - execution of code analysis sometimes causes an exception at databse access -> try with empty database
 - make the release of the connection in each DBAccess method finally
 - searching for a filename in lowercase does not work since the parser parses the search term to lower case

Unexpected Behaviour
===============
 - When using an overloaded method with an external field or external method as parameter it can not be correctly determined which method is the correct one

Missing documentation
===============
 - Make sure all classes are documented (not the methods, but the classes)
