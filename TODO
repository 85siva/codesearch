Missing features
================

 - Highlight search term
 - Go to line
 - Repository file browsing
 - Code navigation side panel
 - fast binary file recognition method
 - Raw file button
 - Extended file information: e.g Author, Commit date etc
 - Enum Handling for Code Navigation
 - Preserve Index Consistency feature
Important TODOs
===============
 - Refactor every System.out that is not in a Unit test
   This helps debugging problems; please use appropriate logging levels
 - Fix exception handling; quite often, 
   problems are just caught and ignored 
   See that exception handling is consistent throughout the program

Minor Bugs
===============
 - usages of parameters in methods are not correctly linked
 - if no record for repository exists in database it should automatically be created
 - PropertyManager constantly assumes that the property file does not exist, therefor creates a new one

Unsolveable bugs
===============
 - When using an overloaded method with an external field or external method as parameter it can not be correctly determined which method is the correct one
